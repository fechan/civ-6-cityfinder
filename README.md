# Civ 6 City Finder
A silly thing I whipped up to jump on the "locating all the cities of [some civilization]"
bandwagon. `scraper.js` scrapes Civ Wiki for city names, then `find-locations.js` searches Wikibase
for their coordinates and outputs GeoJSON for all the cities. Not intended for any serious or
production use.
