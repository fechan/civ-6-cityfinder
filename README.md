# Civ 6 City Finder
A silly thing I whipped up to jump on the "locating all the cities of [some civilization]"
bandwagon. `scraper.js` scrapes Civ Wiki for city names, then `find-locations.js` searches Wikibase
for their coordinates and outputs GeoJSON for all the cities. Not intended for any serious or
production use.

Interactive web viewer for the final data is available at https://fechan.github.io/civ-6-cityfinder/
